                <p>During my time at college, I have actively sought opportunities to immerse myself more in game

                    another level and showcase my expertise to creating and delivering high-quality games, I am keen to
                    bring my passion, technical proficiency, and dedication to any project I undertake.</p>

                <p>The project is a small Tower Deffense game and I worked as a game devloper covering most of the main core gameplay mechanics.</p>
                <p>This was my first collaborative project and gained valuable teamwork experience and got a good understanding on how to work together as a team.</p>
                <p>The timeline was fairly short, so there was a large need for rapid prototpying specifically for the pathfinding of the enemies.</p>

                <p>This truly pushed my problem-solving skills ot the limit as I decided to do it in the time span of two days and managed to get it to a satifactory point.</p>
                <p>It was done in C# and I was alone the entire time, this was quite the challenge especially since I decided to try to implement my first state-machine utilised by a Boss Type Enemy.</p>
